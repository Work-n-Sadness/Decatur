// if the file is meant to be deleted, this would be an empty CDATA.
// Since the instruction was to *rename* and update, a new file moving-in-out/page.tsx will be created,
// and this old one would be removed from the project. For the AI, I'll just provide an empty
// content here to signify it's no longer the active page for this route if the route itself was removed/changed.
// If the route *wasn't* removed and this file should be kept as a redirect or placeholder, 
// appropriate content would be needed. Assuming it's superseded by the new named page.
